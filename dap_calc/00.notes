dap_cal.py is used to generate dap_db.sqlite3 and dap_data.txt files. This process is performed before dr_manager is started up.

dr_manager lookup into dap_db.sqlite3 using (kV, uA, ms) as key, if a DAP_uGym2 value is found, then use it for display; or dr_manager calculates DAP value using the coefficients in table coefficient_tbl. The formula is:
(co_kV * kV + co_mA * uA/1000 + co_sec * ms/1000 + co_D) * co_size_times / 100000

dap_data.txt is generated with dap_db.sqlite3 but it is not used by dr_manager, and it is just for human read by convenience.
